## 🚀 Overview

**Nuclei Command Center** isn't just a UI wrapper; it's an intelligent layer on top of ProjectDiscovery's most powerful tools. It solves the chaos of managing thousands of CLI outputs by providing a unified, persistent database and a smart triage workflow.

Whether you are a **Bug Bounty Hunter**, **Pentester**, or **SOC Analyst**, this dashboard organizes your chaos into actionable insights.

## ✨ Features In-Depth

### 🧠 1. Smart Vulnerability Management
Stop drowning in duplicate CSVs. We treat findings as *living objects*.
*   **Live Ingestion**: Vulnerabilities appear in the dashboard the second they are found.
*   **Intelligent Deduplication**: Uses deterministic hashing (Template ID + Host + Matcher) to ensure unique findings.
*   **Lifecycle Tracking**:
    *   🔵 **New**: Freshly discovered.
    *   🟢 **Fixed**: Automatically detected when a rescan finds the issue is gone.
    *   🔴 **Regression**: Automatically flagged if a "Fixed" issue reappears.
    *   ⚪ **Closed/False Positive**: Manually mark findings to hide them from reports.

### 🌐 2. Asset Inventory & Monitoring (Subfinder)
Know your attack surface.
*   **Continuous Inventory**: Keeps a persistent database of every target you've ever scanned.
*   **"New Discoveries" Feed**: Automatically diffs scan results against history.
    *   *Example*: Scanning `Uber.com` today vs yesterday? It will **only** show you the 5 new subdomains found today.
*   **One-Click pivot**: Click any asset in your inventory to instantly launch a Nuclei scan against it.

### ⚡ 3. Live Asset Probing (HTTPX)
Gain real-time visibility into your infrastructure.
*   **Visual Drill-Down**: Full-screen detail view with high-res screenshots and response metadata.
*   **Tech Stack Detection**: Automatically identifies WAFs, CMS (WordPress, Drupal), and frameworks.
*   **Live Metrics**: Monitors latency, Content-Length, and Status Codes (200, 403, 500) in real-time.
*   **Change Tracking**: Flags "New", "Changed", or "Stale" endpoints between scans.


### 🤖 3. AI-Powered Triage (Gemini)
Don't just find bugs; understand them.
*   **Executive Summaries**: One-click generation of professional risk assessments for any finding.
*   **Context Aware**: AI analyzes the specific request/response and template description to explain *why* it matters.
*   **Remediation Advice**: Get instant, actionable fix context without leaving the dashboard.

### 📊 4. Professional Reporting
Deliver value instantly.
*   **Instant PDF Reports**: Client-ready reports with:
    *   Executive Summary & Scorecard.
    *   Severity Distribution Charts.
    *   Color-coded finding details.
*   **Excel (.xlsx) Export**: Fully colorized spreadsheets for audit logs or data analysis.
*   **Search & Filter**: Powerful boolean filtering by Host, Severity, Status, or Template Name.

### 🛡️ 5. Advanced Target Management
Stop manually typing URLs.
*   **Target List Manager**: A built-in file manager for your scope.
    *   **Upload**: Drag & drop `.txt` lists directly into the dashboard.
    *   **Create**: Paste raw domains and save them as reusable lists.
    *   **Select**: One-click switching between "Single Target" and "Bulk List" modes.
*   **Auto-persistence**: All lists are saved server-side (`scans/uploads/`) and available for future scans.

### 🔐 6. Enterprise-Grade Security
Built to be safe.
*   **Secure Authentication**: NextAuth.js protection loop (Username/Password).
*   **Environment Isolation**: Development logs distinct from production findings.
*   **Dark Mode UI**: "Black & Emerald" theme optimized for low-light SOC environments.

## 🔄 Smart Workflows

### The "Fix & Verify" Loop
1.  **Detect**: Run a **Full Scan** preset on `example.com`.
2.  **Triage**: Finding marked as `Critical` (SQL Injection). AI Summary generated.
3.  **Remediate**: Developer patches the code.
4.  **Verify**: Click **"Rescan"** on the specific finding.
    *   *Scenario A*: Vulnerability is gone ➡️ Status updates to **Fixed**.
    *   *Scenario B*: Vulnerability persists ➡️ Status remains **Confirmed** (Timestamp updated).

### The "Continuous Monitoring" Loop
1.  **Monitor**: Run **Subfinder** on `target.com`.
2.  **Diff**: Dashboard highlights **3 New Subdomains** in the "New Discoveries" feed.
3.  **Scan**: Click the 🎯 **Scan** button on the new assets to run Nuclei.
4.  **Alert**: If vulnerabilities are found, they populate the main feed.
