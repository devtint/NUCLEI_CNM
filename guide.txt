What I want to do ?
1. Clone the style and full usage cmds of nuclei 
2. Make this cmd and functions into easy use for me by making popular and basic cmds into predefined file for me to use with 1 click button for each cmd
3. Have rescan function for me to use with 1 click button for each findings 
    how to do it ?
    1. there is template id for each findings in json format of nuclei output
    2. use this template id to run nuclei again with -t tag 
        example : nuclei -u <target> -t <template id> -o <output>
4. save seperate json files for each scan (not per findings, but include all findings of each scan) 
5. Include Dashboard , Vulnerability , Scans and Report
6. And have a feature to export findings to sv files with colorized output
    Options : 
    1. export all findings to sv files with colorized output
    2. export only findings with severity critical to sv files with colorized output
    3. export only findings with severity high to sv files with colorized output
    4. export only findings with severity medium to sv files with colorized output
    5. export only findings with severity low to sv files with colorized output
    6. export only findings with severity info to sv files with colorized output
